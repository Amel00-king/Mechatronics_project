# Mechatronics_project
Code for an Arduino environmental sensor. Built as group project for Mechatronics class, KCL Bachelors Biomedical Enigneering.

This project is best loaded using VSCode and uploaded via PlatformIO. PlatformIO file is included in the Prototype folder, but the actual program needs to be added as a VSCode extension. 

The python files are the application, and should be opened on Jupyter Labs or Notebook. Please note that the Predictive Neural Network is non-functional. 
I have also uploaded a how-to PDF for anybody hoping to build this on their own. 

Updates may come in the future...
